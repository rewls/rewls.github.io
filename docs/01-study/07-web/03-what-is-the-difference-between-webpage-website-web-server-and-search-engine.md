> 참고: [What is the difference between webpage, website, web server, and search engine?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines)

- Objective: Beable to describe the differences between a web page, a website, a web server, and a search engine

## Web page

- A document which can be displayed in a web browser

- such documents are written in the HTML language

- A web page can embed a variety of difference types of resources such as:

	- Style information: Controlling a page's look-and-fell

	- Scripts: Wchich add interactivity to the page

	- Media: Images, sounds, and videos

> Note
>
> Browsers can also display other documents such as PDF files or images, but the term web page specifically refers to HTML documents. Otherwise, we only use the term document


- All web pages available on the web are reachable through a unique address.

- To access a page, just type its address in your browser address bar

## Web site

- A collections of linked web pages (plus their associated resources) that share a unique domain name

- Each web page of a given website provides explicit links $---$ most of the time in the form of clickable portion of text $---$ that allow the user to move from one page of the website to another

- To access a website, type its domain name in your browser address bar, and the browser will display the website's main web page, or homepage

- A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways.

- The ideas of a web page and a website are especially easy to confuse for a website that contains only one web page

- Such a website is sometimes called a single-page website

## Web server

- A computer hosting one or more websites

- Hosting means that all the web pages and their supporting files are available on that computer

- The web server will send any web page from the website it is hosting to any user's browser, per user request

- A computer that hosts a website on the Internet

- If you hear someone say, "My website is not responding", it actually means that the web server is not responding and therefore the website is not available.

- Since a web server can host multiple websites, the term web server is never used to designate a website

- If we said, "My web server is not responding", it means that multiple websites on that web server are not available

## Search engine

- A special kind of website that helps users find webpages from other websites

- Don't confuse the infrastructure (e.g., the browser) with the service (e.g., the search engine)

- Search engines are normally accessed through a web browser or through a web page
