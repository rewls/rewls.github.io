- Objective: To learn how to use lesser-known HTML element to mark up advanced semantic features

## Description lists

- The purpose of these list is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers

- Description lists use a wrapper `<dl>`; in addition each term is wrapped in a `<dt>`(description term) element, and each description is wrapped in a `<dd>`(description definition) element

### Description list example

```html
<dl>
  <dt>soliloquy</dt>
  <dd>In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the audience (but not to other characters.)</dd>
  <dt>monologue</dt>
  <dd>In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them with the audience and any other characters present.</dd>
  <dt>aside</dt>
  <dd>In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of additional background information.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>soliloquy</dt>
  <dd>In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the audience (but not to other characters.)</dd>
  <dt>monologue</dt>
  <dd>In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them with the audience and any other characters present.</dd>
  <dt>aside</dt>
  <dd>In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of additional background information.</dd>
</dl>

### Multiple descriptions for one term

- It is permitted to have a single term with multiple descriptions

```html
<dl>
  <dt>aside</dt>
  <dd>In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of additional background information.</dd>
  <dd>In writing, a section of content that is related to the current topic, but doesn't fit directly into the main flow of content so is presented nearby (often in a box off to the side.)</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>aside</dt>
  <dd>In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of additional background information.</dd>
  <dd>In writing, a section of content that is related to the current topic, but doesn't fit directly into the main flow of content so is presented nearby (often in a box off to the side.)</dd>
</dl>

## Quotations

- HTML also has features available for marking up quotations; which element you use depends on whether you are marking up a block or inline quotation

### Blockquotes

- If a section of block level content is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a `<blockquote>` element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a `cite` attribute

- For example, the followint markup is taken from the MDN `blockquote>` element page

```html
<p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block
Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.</p>
```

<p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block
Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.</p>

- To turn this into a block quote

```html
<p>Here is a blockquote:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
  <p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block
  Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.</p>
</blockquote>
```

<p>Here is a blockquote:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
  <p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block
  Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.</p>
</blockquote>

### Inline quotations

- Inline quotations work in exactly the same way, except that they use the `<q>` element

- The below bit of markup contains a quotation from the MDN `<q>` page

```html
<p>The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">intended
for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q></p>
```

<p>The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">intended
for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q></p>

### Citations

- The content of the `cite` attribute sounds useful, but browsers, screenreaders, etc

- There is no way to get the browser to display the contents of `cite`, without writing your own solution using JavaScript or CSS

- There is a `<cite>` element, but this is meant to contain the title of the resource being quoted

```html
<p>According to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
<cite>MDN blockquote page</cite></a>:
</p>

<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
  <p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block
  Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">intended
for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q> — <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">
<cite>MDN q page</cite></a>.</p>
```

<p>According to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
<cite>MDN blockquote page</cite></a>:
</p>

<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
  <p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block
  Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">intended
for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q> — <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">
<cite>MDN q page</cite></a>.</p>

## Abbreviations

- `<abbr>` element is used to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym, and provide a full expansion of the term (included inside a `title` attribute)

### Abbreviation example

```html
<p>We use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to structure our web documents.</p>

<p>I think <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Green did it in the kitchen with the chainsaw.</p>
```

<p>We use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to structure our web documents.</p>

<p>I think <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Green did it in the kitchen with the chainsaw.</p>

- The expansion will appear in a tooltip when the term is hovered over

## Marking up contact details

- `<address>` element wraps around your contact details

```html
<address>
  Chris Mills, Manchester, The Grim North, UK
</address>
```

<address>
  Chris Mills, Manchester, The Grim North, UK
</address>

- It could also include more complex markup, and other forms of contact information

```html
<address>
  <p>
    Chris Mills<br>
    Manchester<br>
    The Grim North<br>
    UK
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tel: 01234 567 890</li>
    <li>Email: me@grim-north.co.uk</li>
  </ul>
</address>
```

<address>
  <p>
    Chris Mills<br>
    Manchester<br>
    The Grim North<br>
    UK
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tel: 01234 567 890</li>
    <li>Email: me@grim-north.co.uk</li>
  </ul>
</address>

> Note
>
> `<address>` element should only be used to provide contact information for the document cotained with the nearest `<article>` or `<body>` element. It would be correct to use it in the footer of a site to include the contact information of the entire site, or inside an article for the contact details of the author, but not to mark up a list of addresses unrelated to the content of that page

## superscript and subscript

- The `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements represent superscript and subscript

```html
<p>My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.</p>
<p>Caffeine's chemical formula is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>If x<sup>2</sup> is 9, x must equal 3 or -3.</p>
```

<p>My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.</p>
<p>Caffeine's chemical formula is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>If x<sup>2</sup> is 9, x must equal 3 or -3.</p>

## Representing computer code

- There are a number of elements available for marking up computer code using HTML

- `<code>`: For marking up generic pieces of computer code

- `<pre>`: For retaining whitespace (generally code blocks), your whitespace will be rendered identically to how you seeit in your text editor

- `<var>`: For specifically marking up variable names

- `<kbd>`: For marking up keyboard (and other types of ) input entered into the computer

- `<samp>`: For marking up the output of a computer program

```html
<pre><code>var para = document.querySelector('p');

para.onclick = function() {
  alert('Owww, stop poking me!');
}</code></pre>

<p>You shouldn't use presentational elements like <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;center&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In the above JavaScript example, <var>para</var> represents a paragraph element.</p>

<p>Select all the text with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>.</p>

<pre>$ <kbd>ping mozilla.org</kbd>
<samp>PING mozilla.org (63.245.215.20): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 63.245.215.20: icmp_seq=0 ttl=40 time=158.233 ms</samp></pre>
```

<pre><code>var para = document.querySelector('p');

para.onclick = function() {
  alert('Owww, stop poking me!');
}</code></pre>

<p>You shouldn't use presentational elements like <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;center&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In the above JavaScript example, <var>para</var> represents a paragraph element.</p>

<p>Select all the text with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>.</p>

<pre>$ <kbd>ping mozilla.org</kbd>
<samp>PING mozilla.org (63.245.215.20): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 63.245.215.20: icmp_seq=0 ttl=40 time=158.233 ms</samp></pre>

## Marking up times and dates

- HTML also provides the `<time>` element for marking up times and dates in a machine-readable format

```html
<time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>
```

- The `<time>` element allows you to attach an unambiguous, machine-readable time/date for this purpose

```html
<!-- Standard simple date -->
<time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>
<!-- Just year and month -->
<time datetime="2016-01">January 2016</time>
<!-- Just month and day -->
<time datetime="01-20">20 January</time>
<!-- Just time, hours and minutes -->
<time datetime="19:30">19:30</time>
<!-- You can do seconds and milliseconds too! -->
<time datetime="19:30:01.856">19:30:01.856</time>
<!-- Date and time -->
<time datetime="2016-01-20T19:30">7.30pm, 20 January 2016</time>
<!-- Date and time with timezone offset -->
<time datetime="2016-01-20T19:30+01:00">7.30pm, 20 January 2016 is 8.30pm in France</time>
<!-- Calling out a specific week number -->
<time datetime="2016-W04">The fourth week of 2016</time>
```

<!-- Standard simple date -->
<time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>
<!-- Just year and month -->
<time datetime="2016-01">January 2016</time>
<!-- Just month and day -->
<time datetime="01-20">20 January</time>
<!-- Just time, hours and minutes -->
<time datetime="19:30">19:30</time>
<!-- You can do seconds and milliseconds too! -->

<!-- Date and time -->
<time datetime="2016-01-20T19:30">7.30pm, 20 January 2016</time>
